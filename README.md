# Windows Optimization Guide 

***I recommend you to use the HTML version of this guide, take me now!***

Windows despite being the operating system with the largest market share in the world does not make it the most "light" for everyone, it is understandable, since it is focused on so many end users with many different needs and a lot of hardware, **it's hard for everyone to have a good experience**.

I created this small repository with some extra files (which I will explain what each of them are for) to make a simple guide to optimize windows to the maximum

⚠ ***90% OF THE SCRIPTS ARE MADE BY OTHER PEOPLE***

I will just give a simple explanation of what each of these do, how to use them and other extra stuff.

I will also give credit to each person and links to the repositories.

1) [Download Windows 10](#getWin10)

## Before you start

I will assume you are on a fresh installation of windows, it is the most recommended if you want a functional and practically garbage free system, I would personally recommend to do it at least once a year.

<h3 id="getWin10">Obtain Windows 10 ISOs</h3>

There are several ways to obtain ISOs of Windows 10 and also quite simple.

1) [Official (Slow):](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) Downloading the system update tool to get the latest version of the system (This will download a system update download tool, a bit slow compared to the next way).
2) [Official (Faster?):](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) Now instead of using the above tool we will download an ISO directly from the site, just follow a few steps to start with

    a) use one of the following key combinations
⚠ ***Personally I think this is a bad idea because in Windows 10 the newer the version the heavier the ISO, the longer it takes to install, MUCH SLOWER. Unless you want to be sure to use a more recent version and therefore more secure.***
